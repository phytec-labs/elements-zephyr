API Changes
***********

* Removed SETTINGS_USE_BASE64 support as its been deprecated for more than
  two releases.

* The :c:func:`lwm2m_rd_client_start` function now accepts an additional
  ``flags`` parameter, which allows to configure current LwM2M client session,
  for instance enable bootstrap procedure in the curent session.

* LwM2M execute now supports arguments. The execute callback
  `lwm2m_engine_execute_cb_t` is extended with an ``args`` parameter which points
  to the CoAP payload that comprises the arguments, and an ``args_len`` parameter
  to indicate the length of the ``args`` data.

* Changed vcnl4040 dts binding default for property 'proximity-trigger'.
  Changed the default to match the HW POR state for this property.

* The :c:func:`clock_control_async_on` function will now take ``callback`` and
  ``user_data`` as arguments instead of structure which contained list node,
  callback and user data.

* The :c:func:`mqtt_keepalive_time_left` function now returns -1 if keep alive
  messages are disabled by setting ``CONFIG_MQTT_KEEPALIVE`` to 0.

* The ``CONFIG_LEGACY_TIMEOUT_API`` mode has been removed.  All kernel
  timeout usage must use the new-style k_timeout_t type and not the
  legacy/deprecated millisecond counts.

* The :c:func:`coap_pending_init` function now accepts an additional ``retries``
  parameter, allowing to specify the maximum retransmission count of the
  confirmable message.

* The ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_CODED_PHY`` is now disabled by default for builds
  combining both Bluetooth host and controller.

* The :c:func:`coap_packet_append_payload` function will now take a pointer to a
  constant buffer as the ``payload`` argument instead of a pointer to a writable
  buffer.

* The :c:func:`coap_packet_init` function will now take a pointer to a constant
  buffer as the ``token`` argument instead of a pointer to a writable buffer.

* A new :ref:`regulator_api` API has been added to support controlling power
  sources.  Regulators can also be associated with devicetree nodes, allowing
  drivers to ensure the device they access has been powered up.  For simple
  GPIO-only regulators a devicetree property ``supply-gpios`` is defined as a
  standard way to identify the control signal in nodes that support power
  control.

* :c:type:`fs_tile_t` objects must now be initialized by calling
  :c:func:`fs_file_t_init` before their first use.

Deprecated in this release
==========================

* Nordic nRF5340 PDK board deprecated and planned to be removed in 2.6.0.
* ARM Musca-A board and SoC support deprecated and planned to be removed in 2.6.0.

* DEVICE_INIT was deprecated in favor of utilizing DEVICE_DEFINE directly.

* DEVICE_AND_API_INIT was deprecated in favor of DEVICE_DT_INST_DEFINE and
  DEVICE_DEFINE.

* Bluetooth

  * Deprecated the :c:func:`bt_set_id_addr` function, use :c:func:`bt_id_create`
    before calling :c:func:`bt_enable` instead. When ``CONFIG_PRIVACY`` is
    enabled a valid IRK has to be supplied by the application for this case.

Removed APIs in this release
============================

* Bluetooth

  * The deprecated BT_LE_SCAN_FILTER_DUPLICATE define has been removed,
    use BT_LE_SCAN_OPT_FILTER_DUPLICATE instead.
  * The deprecated BT_LE_SCAN_FILTER_WHITELIST define has been removed,
    use BT_LE_SCAN_OPT_FILTER_WHITELIST instead.
  * The deprecated bt_le_scan_param::filter_dup argument has been removed,
    use bt_le_scan_param::options instead.
  * The deprecated bt_conn_create_le() function has been removed,
    use bt_conn_le_create() instead.
  * The deprecated bt_conn_create_auto_le() function has been removed,
    use bt_conn_le_create_auto() instead.
  * The deprecated bt_conn_create_slave_le() function has been removed,
    use bt_le_adv_start() instead with bt_le_adv_param::peer set to the remote
    peers address.
  * The deprecated BT_LE_ADV_* macros have been removed,
    use the BT_GAP_ADV_* enums instead.
  * The deprecated bt_conn_security function has been removed,
    use bt_conn_set_security instead.
  * The deprecated BT_SECURITY_* defines NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, FIPS have been
    removed, use the L0, L1, L2, L3, L4 defines instead.
  * The deprecated BT_HCI_ERR_AUTHENTICATION_FAIL define has been removed,
    use BT_HCI_ERR_AUTH_FAIL instead.

* Kernel

  * The deprecated k_mem_pool API has been removed entirely (for the
    past release it was backed by a k_heap, but maintained a
    compatible API).  Now all instantiated heaps must be
    sys_heap/k_heaps.  Note that the new-style heap is a general
    purpose allocator and does not make the same promises about block
    alignment/splitting.  Applications with such requirements should
    look at porting their logic, or perhaps at the k_mem_slab utility.

Drivers and Sensors
*******************

* ADC

* Audio

* Bluetooth

* CAN

  * We reworked the configuration API.
    A user can now specify the timing manually (define prop segment,
    phase segment1, phase segment2, and prescaler) or use a newly introduced
    algorithm to calculate optimal timing values from a bitrate and sample point.
    The bitrate and sample point can be specified in the device tree too.
    It is possible to change the timing values at runtime now.

  * We reworked the zcan_frame struct due to undefined behavior.
    The std_id (11-bit) and ext_id (29-bit) are merged to a single id
    field (29-bit). The union of both IDs was removed.

  * We made the CANbus API CAN-FD compatible.
    The zcan_frame data-field can have a size of >8 bytes now.
    A flag was introduced to mark a zcan_frame as CAN-FD frame.
    A flag was introduced that enables a bitrate switch in CAN-FD frames.
    The configuration API supports an additional timing parameter for the CAN-FD
    data-phase.

  * drivers are converted to use the new DEVICE_DT_* macros.

  * The ``bt_mesh_cfg_srv`` structure has been deprecated in favor of a
    standalone Heartbeat API and Kconfig entries for default state values.

Build and Infrastructure
************************

* Improved support for additional toolchains:

* Devicetree

  * :c:macro:`DT_ENUM_IDX_OR`: new macro
  * Support for legacy devicetree macros via
    ``CONFIG_LEGACY_DEVICETREE_MACROS`` was removed. All devicetree-based code
    should be using the new devicetree API introduced in Zephyr 2.3 and
    documented in :ref:`dt-from-c`. Information on flash partitions has moved
    to :ref:`flash_map_api`.
  * It is now possible to resolve at build time the device pointer associated
    with a device that is defined in devicetree, via ``DEVICE_DT_GET``.  See
    :ref:`dt-get-device`.

* West

  * Improve bossac runner. It supports now native ROM bootloader for Atmel
    MCUs and extended SAM-BA bootloader like Arduino and Adafruit UF2. The
    devices supported depend on bossac version inside Zephyr SDK or in users
    path. The recommended Zephyr SDK version is 0.12.0 or newer.

      from base address of offered upload slot.
